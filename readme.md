## 👨‍💻 About Me

I started my coding journey in 2021 with web development and, over time, naturally gravitated toward building things—mostly small, fast, and useful micro-SaaS projects.

I launched two such projects:

- [**SearchLens**](https://searchlens.co/) – helped marketers explore SEO keywords more intuitively.
- [**Onmail**](http://beonmail.com/) – a productivity-focused email client for simplified inbox management

Since I previously worked in digital marketing, I understood many of the industry’s pain points. These projects taught me to ship quickly, listen to users, and experiment without overthinking.

I love building and sharing projects online!

## 🔗 What I'm Working On

These days, I’m deep into **Solidity development**, working on smart contracts, DeFi protocol interactions, and various DApp components.

I use **Foundry** for most of my workflow—writing tests, fuzzing edge cases, and running basic security audits to understand how contracts behave under different scenarios.

At the core, I just enjoy building things, learning by doing, and exploring new ideas.

### Achievements

- Participated in **20+ hackathons**, with **6 wins**
- Built and launched **two SaaS platforms** on Product Hunt
- Completed internships at **two startups**

### Updates (December 2025)

- I’m open to opportunities as a **Smart Contract Engineer** or in **Fullstack Development**.
- Currently diving deeper into **DeFi protocols** — reading multiple whitepapers and building a project focused on **cross-chain bridging solutions**.
